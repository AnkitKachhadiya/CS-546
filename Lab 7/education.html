                <p>
                    Currently I am pursuing my Master's in Computer Science from
                    University of Helsinki. I chose this university because the
                    education system in Finland is considered one of the best in
                    the world. An equal school system, high regard for teachers,
                    research, innovation and top-quality teaching have played a
                    significant role in making it a success.
                </p>
                <p>My favorite class is Automated Logical Reasoning.</p>

                    Meeting Linus Torvalds when he came to University for guest
                    lecture is one of the most memorable memory.
