                Born to poor gypsies in the small European nation of Latveria,
                Victor Von Doom lost his mother to a soldier’s anger, and not
                long after lost his father to a king’s revenge. Alone, the young
                Victor discovered his mother’s trove of mystical artifacts and
                set himself on a path of darkness when he realized her spirit
                was subject to a demon she’d bargained with. His incredible
                scientific acumen won him a scholarship at America’s State
                University in New York, and he left his native country seeking
                knowledge with which to salve his wounded soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                During his time in New York, Von Doom met another scientific
                prodigy, Reed Richards, and the two formed an immediate rivalry.
                When the Latverian student secretly experimented with a device
                of his own creation to bridge the gap between dimensions, only
                for it to literally blow up in his face, he found himself
                expelled, with only small scars on his face in return. Loathing
                his marred good looks and furious at fate’s fickle finger, Von
                Doom made his way to Tibet to allow his anger an outlet. There,
                he dominated a circle of monks and after learning their secrets
                directed them to forge him a suit of armor and an iron mask to
                hide his face from the world forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Doctor Doom, he returned to Latveria, overthrew its monarch,
                and renamed its capital Doomstadt while further developing his
                command of science through robotics, weaponry, and even time
                travel. Secure in his rulership and with formidable forces at
                his command, Von Doom set out to conquer the globe, as well as
                rescue his mother’s soul, and prove himself superior to Reed
                Richards, the only man he’d ever met who might equal his own
                scientific genius.
